Pairwar by Alex Speasmaker


This program is implemented using pthreads and the function pthread_cond_wait.
The program uses a deque data structure that I implemented myself with a head
and a tail pointer.  The deque is accessed using two functions pop() and
push_back().

Chronology of program:

The program receives a seed as input from the user and uses the default seed
if none is provided.  

The program removes the file "output.txt" if it already exists and will create
it if it doesn't.  If there is any error opening the file, the user will be
notified.

The program spawns 4 threads, one dealer and 3 players.
Each player has an element in the player_hand1 and player_hand2 arrays.

The dealer first waits for all threads to spawn by checking the associated
value in the startCond array or the players value in startArray.  Once all
players have signaled the dealer, the game begins.

Each thread is in a loop that is stopped by the value of current_round
reaching a maximum value.  each player executes the player_turn function which
contains all the code for a palyers turn.  If the function returns true then
the player won and the current round is short circuted and dealer is signaled
to begin a new round.

Once the round threshold has been reached each player signals the next in
sequence, prints that it is exiting releases the lock and exits.
